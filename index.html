      <h2>Our Mission</h2>

      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>Our Director, Dr. Shungo, is a seasoned physician who earned his degree from the National Defense Medical College in Japan and began his career as a Flight Surgeon with the Japanese Self-Defense Force. During his academic career, he worked at the University of Pennsylvania and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. For the past few years, he has been engaged in Veterans Affairs (VA) Disability Examinations. Since June 1, 2025, we have relocated to fully focus on VA examinations, including Audiology, General Medicine, and Sleep Studies. We take pride in serving those who have served our country, the United States.</p>

      <p>Our VA examination services are a crucial step in the journey toward veterans receiving government benefits. We will perform a comprehensive and impartial evaluation, documenting the severity of disabilities and their connection to military service. However, we do not provide treatment, refer patients to specialists, or make final determinations regarding service connections.</p>

      <h3>Process Summary</h3>
      <p>If you have submitted a claim to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for disability compensation or pension benefits and it has been approved, the VA will randomly assign you to an examiner for your disability evaluation. In partnership with International SOS, Dr. Shungo, a certified VA examiner, will perform the examination. This process includes reviewing medical records, performing a physical exam, asking detailed questions regarding your medical history and symptoms, as well as evaluating how the claimed disabilities affect your ablity to perform any occupational task. We aim to facilitate these steps for veterans in a comfortable and efficient manner.</p>
